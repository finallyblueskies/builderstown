# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

# Image Cleaner

A Node.js script that recursively scans directories for images with the format `<name>-<width>x<height>.<extension>`, groups them by name, and keeps only the largest version of each image while deleting the rest.

## Usage

```bash
# Make the script executable (Unix/Linux/macOS)
chmod +x image-cleaner.js

# Run the script on the current directory
./image-cleaner.js

# Or specify a directory
./image-cleaner.js /path/to/images

# Alternatively, run with node
node image-cleaner.js /path/to/images
```

## How it works

1. The script recursively scans all directories starting from the specified path
2. It identifies images with the format `<name>-<width>x<height>.<extension>`
3. Images are grouped by their base name (everything before the dimensions)
4. For each group, it keeps only the image with the largest dimensions (width Ã— height)
5. All other images in the group are deleted
6. Images that don't match the pattern are left untouched

## Example

If you have the following files:
```
logo-100x50.png
logo-200x100.png
logo-50x25.png
icon.png
```

After running the script, you'll have:
```
logo-200x100.png  (kept because it has the largest dimensions)
icon.png          (kept because it doesn't match the pattern)
```

## Requirements

- Node.js (v10.0.0 or higher recommended)
