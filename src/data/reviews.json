      "testimonial": "Unfortunately Vasyl misjudged the job and it was out of his capabilities. He made a few mistakes including damaging my bath which he lied about. Whilst accidents happen, dishonesty is not acceptable. He claimed it wasn't him (even though he tried to glue it back) by saying he didn't have glue and it couldn't have been him - I then found the glue on the side. On this basis I wouldn't recommend.",

I always try to provide good quality work and stay in touch with clients, so I'm sad to hear this situation has made you feel different. I remember the job well and don't recall damaging the bath or encountering issues with you around this. I also would never repair anything without talking to you first. Honesty is very important to me in all my work, so maybe there was a miscommunication with me or someone I worked with. I've had the pleasure of working with many clients over the years, and I deeply value the trust they've placed in me."
